##  Algorithms Implemented

### ðŸ”¹ Search

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### ðŸ”¹ Shortest Path Algorithms

- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**: Fast, for non-negative weights
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Handles negative weights, detects cycles
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: All-pairs shortest paths using dynamic programming

### ðŸ”¹ Topological and Longest Path

- **Topological Sort**: DFS-based implementation
- **Longest Path in DAG**: Uses topological order

### ðŸ”¹ Connected Components

- Find connected regions in undirected graphs and grids

## ðŸ›  How to Run

Each file is self-contained. Just run the scripts directly:

```bash
python bfs.py
python bellman_ford.py
